# Boxhead1

<h1>Boxhead</h1>
<h3>A singleplayer, wave-based shooting game where the player must survive against mobs of zombies and devils by picking up different guns to defend themself. </h3> 

<h2> How the game works </h2>

<h3> Player, Player Movement </h3>
The player begins off with 100 health points, and can not increase this amount or regain health points throughout the game. The player moves at a faster speed than the zombies and devils, and movement can be controlled with WASD (W - up, A - left, S - down, D - right).

<h3> Rounds, Boundaries </h3>
<p>Round one begins with thirty zombies and one devil. Each additional round, thirty more zombies and one more devil is spawned, gradually increasing the difficulty of the game. The score increases by 100 for each zombie kill and 500 for each devil kill. The map surrounds the edges of the screen and the player cannot move outside of the boundaries. </p>

<h3> Guns, Boxes </h3>
There are seven different guns in the game: Pistol (default gun), Uzi, Rocket, Sniper, Railgun, Ak-47, and Shotgun. Guns can be fired by pressing the space key. If the player has multiple guns, guns can be rotated by pressing the , and . keys. Each gun has a different firing rate, amount of damage, firing distance, ammo, and chance to obtain the gun. The firing rate of each gun will be visually displayed so the player knows when a shot is ready to be fired. All guns can shoot through multiple targets at once with no decrease in damage. In addition, the player starts off with a pistol with 10,000 ammo. New guns can be obtained by stepping over red boxes. Red boxes can either give the player new weapons or refill ammo on previous weapons. Three red boxes are spawned at the beginning of the game and more red boxes can be obtained by killing devils. 

<h3> Zombies, Devils </h3>
The zombies and devils both follow the player around the map. They can only attack the player within melee range, both do the same amount of damage, move at the same speed, and have the same hitbox. However, zombies only have 100 health points, while devils have 200 health points. Zombies are a white/gray color, while devils are a red/black color. 

<h3> Technologies Used </h3>
We coded the project with Java and made use of JFrame, KeyListener, ImageIcon, and Graphics. These technologies were used to create the map of the game and allow for graphics to be displayed. KeyListener allowed us to implement player movement throughout the map and ImageIcon gave us the ability to use our images in the game. We used Adobe Illustator to create all of the graphics, most of them being based off the original game of Boxhead (no longer playable due to flash being unsupported). 

<h3> Challenges Faced </h3>


2. Project Description
What your application does,
Why you used the technologies you used,
Some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future.

4. How to Install and Run the Project
If you are working on a project that a user needs to install or run locally in a machine like a "POS", you should include the steps required to install your project and also the required dependencies if any.
Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment set and running.

5. How to Use the Project
Provide instructions and examples so users/contributors can use the project. This will make it easy for them in case they encounter a problem â€“ they will always have a place to reference what is expected.
You can also make use of visual aids by including materials like screenshots to show examples of the running project and also the structure and design principles used in your project.
Also if your project will require authentication like passwords or usernames, this is a good section to include the credentials.

6. Include Credits
If you worked on the project as a team or an organization, list your collaborators/team members. You should also include links to their GitHub profiles and social media too.
This is just a way to show your appreciation and also to help others get a first hand copy of the project.

7. Add a License
For most README files, this is usually considered the last part. It lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project.
We have different types of licenses depending on the kind of project you are working on. Depending on the one you will choose it will determine the contributions your project gets.
The most common one is the GPL License which allows other to make modification to your code and use it for commercial purposes. If you need help choosing a license, use check out this link: https://choosealicense.com/
Up to this point what we have covered are the minimum requirements for a good README. But you might also want to consider adding the following sections to make it more eye catching and interactive.
